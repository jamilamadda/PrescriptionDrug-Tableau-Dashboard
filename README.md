# Drug Prescription Trends & Opioid Impact in Tennessee (2019–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes prescription patterns across major drug classes in Tennessee using data from the **Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File**. The goal was to transform SQL-based analysis into a **clear, insight-driven Tableau dashboard** that highlights prescription behavior, cost impact, and public health implications—particularly related to the opioid crisis.

The project was completed as part of the **Tableau skills at Nashville Software School**, with a focus on moving from raw data to decision-ready visual storytelling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze prescription trends across multiple drug classes
- Identify provider-level and specialty-level patterns
- Detect outliers and high-risk prescription behavior
- Connect prescription data with opioid mortality trends
- Communicate insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard

---

## 📊 Drug Classes Analyzed
The dashboard focuses on four major drug categories:

### 1. Antibiotics
- Prescribed by approximately **6,000 providers**
- Top specialties include **Family Practice** and **Nurse Practitioners**, with notable contributions from **Dental** and **Urology**
- Highlights concerns around **overprescription** and growing **antibiotic resistance**

### 2. Antipsychotics
- **Nurse Practitioners** account for the highest claim volume
- **Total claim count exceeds 26 million**, surpassing antibiotics
- Indicates high utilization and long-term treatment patterns

### 3. Long-Acting Opioids
- Typically prescribed for **severe pain management**, including cancer-related pain
- **~$14 million in annual claim costs**
- Common drugs include **Morphine, Fentanyl, and OxyContin**
- Represents a high-cost, high-risk medication category

### 4. Opioids (Deep Dive)
- Opioid claims significantly exceed all other drug classes
- A notable provider-level outlier was identified:
  - A Tennessee prescriber later convicted for operating a pill mill
  - Nearly **$5 million in opioid prescriptions over 8 years**
- Demonstrates how data analysis can surface **systemic abuse and fraud**

## 🚨 Opioid Mortality Insights
The dashboard extends beyond prescriptions to examine opioid-related deaths in the U.S.:

- **Highest overdose deaths** occur in the **35–44 age group**, impacting prime working and parenting years
- **Southeastern states**, including **Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas**, show the highest mortality rates
- A 20-year trend analysis reveals a **continued escalation in opioid deaths**, despite increased awareness efforts

---

## 🔑 Key Findings
1. Prescription opioids remain a major contributor to addiction and overdose deaths in the U.S.
2. Middle-aged adults and Southeastern states bear the heaviest burden.
3. Rising mortality trends signal the need for stronger, data-driven prevention and policy strategies.
